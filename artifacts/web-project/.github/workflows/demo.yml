# job Artifacts are outputs produced by a job, like executables, builds or log files.
# You can upload and download job artifacts using the actions/upload-artifact and actions/download-artifact
# These can be used to share data between jobs in a workflow or to persist data after a workflow has completed.

# We can also use outputs from one job in another job.
# Set like this- run : echo '{output-name}={output-value}' >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
# Retrive like this - "${ needs.{job-id}.outputs.{output-name} }}"

# To speed up our jobs, we can cache dependencies between jobs/workflows using actions/cache
# These caches are stored centrally by GitHub and can be shared between jobs and workflows.
# After the first run, subsequent runs restore the cache if the key matches.
